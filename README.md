# mle

mle is a small but powerful console text editor written in C.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adsr/mle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adsr/mle)

### Features

* Small codebase (~6k sloc)
* Only 1 out-of-repo dependency (pcre)
* Full UTF-8 support
* Syntax highlighting
* Stackable key maps (modes)
* Extensible via any language (via stdio)
* Scriptable rc file
* Macros
* Multiple windows
* Window splitting
* Regex search and replace
* Large file support
* Incremental search
* Fuzzy file search via [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
* File browsing via [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/)
* File grep
* Multiple cursors
* Mutate text via any shell command

### Building

    $ git clone https://github.com/adsr/mle.git
    $ cd mle
    $ git submodule update --init --recursive
    $ sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev # or yum install pcre-devel, etc
    $ make

You can run `make mle_static` instead to build a static binary.

### mlerc

mle is customized via an rc file, `~/.mlerc` (or `/etc/mlerc`). The contents of
the rc file are any number of cli options separated by newlines. (Run `mle -h`
to view all cli options.) Lines that begin with a semi-colon are comments.

Alternatively, if `~/.mlerc` is executable, mle executes it and interprets the
resulting stdout as described above.

For example, my rc file is an executable php script, and includes the following
snippet, which overrides `grep` with `git grep` if `.git` exists in the current
working directory.

    <?php if (file_exists('.git')): ?>
    -kcmd_grep,M-q,git grep --color=never -P -i -I -n %s 2>/dev/null
    <?php endif; ?>

### Scripting

mle is extensible via any program capable of standard I/O. A simple
line-based request/response protocol enables user scripts to register commands
and invoke internal editor functions in order to perform complex editing tasks.
All messages are URL-encoded and end with a newline.

Example exchange between a user script and mle:

    usx -> mle    method=editor_register_cmd&params%5B%5D=hello&id=57cc98bb168ae
    mle -> usx    result%5Brc%5D=0&id=57cc98bb168ae
    ...
    mle -> usx    method=hello&params%5Bmark%5D=76d6e0&params%5Bstatic_param%5D=&id=0x76d3a0-0
    usx -> mle    method=mark_insert_before&params%5B%5D=76d6e0&params%5B%5D=hello%3F&params%5B%5D=5&id=57cc98bb6ab3d
    mle -> usx    result%5Brc%5D=0&id=57cc98bb6ab3d
    usx -> mle    result%5Brc%5D=0&error=&id=0x76d3a0-0

In the example above, the user script registers a command called `hello` at
startup, and mle replies with success. Later, the end-user invokes the `hello`
command, so mle sends a request to the user script. The user script receives the
request and sends a sub-request invoking `mark_insert_before`, to which mle
replies with success. Finally the user script returns overall success for the
`hello` command.

Currently, mle only accepts requests from user scripts while a request to the
user script itself is pending. (In other words, mle enforces an "only do stuff
if I ask you to" policy.) The exception to this is `editor_register_cmd` which
can be invoked by user scripts at startup time.

For end-users, user scripts are loaded via the `-x` cli option. Commands
registered by user scripts can be mapped to keys as normal via `-k`.

### Runtime dependencies (optional)

The following programs will enable or enhance certain features of mle if they
exist in `PATH`.

* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) (tab completion)
* [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (fuzzy file search)
* [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) (file grep)
* [tree](http://mama.indstate.edu/users/ice/tree/) (file browsing)

### Known bugs

* Multi-line style rules don't work properly when overlapped/staggered.
* There's a segfault lurking in the window split code. I can't reliably
  reproduce it.

### Acknowledgements

mle makes extensive use of the following libraries.
